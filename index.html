      </div>
      <div id="content">

        <p>ClearSign makes it easy to verify <a href="http://www.gnupg.org">GPG</a>
          signed text blocks on webpages with a simple Javascript inclusion.</p>

        <p>ClearSign works by sending signed text from an HTML element back to a
          PHP wrapper around GPG to extract the signing key id, fetching the key
          id from a key server and validating the signed text against the key.
          Markup on the page is altered by ClearSign to show the signature text
          and the validity of the signature.</p>

        <p>Encryption and signatures are hard to use and are rarely integrated
          with web content. ClearSign aims to make it easier to use GPG verified
          content in your existing sites.</p>

        <h2>Examples</h2>
        GPG signatures do not exactly make for pretty markup. Here's what one
        actually looks like:
        <pre>
-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

This is an example of what clearsigned text looks like.
-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----
Version: GnuPG v1.4.12 (Darwin)

KcYAn1r6b8JSh3rswpUIMRqZysEa0JDM
=BV0X
-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----</pre>

        <p>The actual content to data ratio here is rather low, it is not symantic,
          won't fit in with your existing design and at the end of it, it is more
          than a hard sell to anyone design oriented.</p>

        <h3>Verified example</h3>
        The point behind ClearSign is to get the signed content front and center
        while providing access to the original data. A small badge shows you the
        status of the signature.
        <div class="gpg-signed-text">

          This is a text file

        <h3>Failed verification example</h3>
        Here the content is invalid- either the key is wrong, the
        text has been altered, or the content was improperly signed.
        <div class="gpg-signed-text">
          -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
          Hash: SHA1

          this is some test text which will fail the verification.

        <a name="implement"></a>
        <h2>How to implement</h2>
        Implementing the verification service is easy!
        <ul>
          <li>Add this javascript to your page: <br />
            <code>&lt;script src="https://clearsign.me/clearsign.js"/&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code>
          </li>
          <li>Use GPG to sign content that you are posting on your site.</li>
          <li>Wrap your GPG clear signed blocks on your pages with <br>
            <code>&lt;div class="gpg-signed-text"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>You can check this project out from github and run the
        verification service yourself. <a href="https://github.com/arthur24b6/clearsign">https://github.com/arthur24b6/clearsign</a>
        </p>

        <p>In order to keep the implementation as simple as possible, ClearSign
          adds jQuery (if not already present) and a CSS file from the one file
          you need to include to make it work.</p>

        <p>By default, ClearSign will be implemented on all .gpg-signed-text
          elements. You can instantiate it yourself with
          <code>$(element).clearsign();</code> You can pass options into it
          including alternate style sheets and paths to use a different
          validator. You can hack the HTML that it produces fairly easily.
        </p>



        <a name="why"></a>
        <h2>Why do this?</h2>
        <p>Signed text by content creators creates a level of trust for readers
          that content is being produced by a specific person.</p>
        <p>Displaying signed text in web pages is unwieldy and requires a reader
          to copy the text off the page, paste it into a file and validate it,
          usually on the commandline. ClearSign is an attempt to make this process
          seamless for the reader.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a world where surveillance is practically ubiquitous this is a small
          step toward normalizing the process of securing data.
        </p>


        <a name="limits"></a>
        <h2>Limits</h2>
        <p>ClearSign is not a security solution. It only verifies text against the
          key that signed the text which means that it cannot prove who used the
          private key to sign the text- only that anyone who has access to the
          key did.</p>
        <p>Like all web services ClearSign is subject to manipulation.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>ClearSign must be run from a server outside your infrastructure.
            If you site is compromised that the validation of text can be easily
            manipulated if the attacker has access to your server
          </li>
          <li>Person-in-the-middle attacks are an easy way to change the text
            being signed or the returned validation. HTTPS should always be used
            to communicate with the validator, however we know that this is not
            a guarantee against corruption. It is also possible that the key
            fetched from the keyserver has been tampered with by similar means.
          </li>
          <li>Signing text requires content creators to have knowledge of GPG.
            This does not provide an interface for generating secure text which
            limits the ability of people to use it.
          </li>
        </ul>
